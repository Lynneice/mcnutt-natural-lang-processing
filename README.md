## Directory Layout

Each main directory follows a consistent structure:

```
category/
├── models/       # Trained model files
├── data/         # Training and test datasets
├── notebooks/    # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
├── scripts/      # Training and inference scripts
└── README.md     # Category-specific documentation
```

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate category for your NLU project
2. Place your files in the corresponding subdirectories
3. Refer to each category's README for specific guidance

## Contributing

When adding new models or datasets:
- Use descriptive names for files
- Document model performance and parameters
- Include example usage in notebooks
- Add preprocessing scripts when applicable
